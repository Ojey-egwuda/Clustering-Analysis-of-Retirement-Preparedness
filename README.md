# Clustering-Analysis-of-Retirement-Preparedness-with-Benefit-Plans

### Project Overview

This project leverages clustering techniques to analyze retirement preparedness among individuals with Defined Benefit (DB) plans using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). By segmenting the data, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can help improve retirement planning strategies.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) from the US Federal Reserve. The SCF dataset contains detailed information on household finances, including income, net worth, assets, debts, and retirement plans.

### Results

The clustering analysis identified three distinct groups among individuals with defined benefit plans:
The analysis shows a clear distinction in retirement preparedness among the different clusters. Individuals in Cluster 2 are significantly better prepared for retirement compared to those in Clusters 0 and 1. This suggests that having a Defined Benefit plan, along with substantial assets, plays a critical role in ensuring financial stability during retirement.

Cluster 2 represents the most financially secure group with high asset values and net worth, while Cluster 1 represents the least wealthy group.

### Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the financial readiness of different segments of the population with defined benefit plans. The findings can inform policymakers and financial planners in their efforts to improve retirement outcomes for various groups.
